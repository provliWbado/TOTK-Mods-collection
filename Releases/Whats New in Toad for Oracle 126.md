# What's New in Toad for Oracle 12.6?
 
Toad for Oracle is a popular and powerful tool for Oracle database development and administration. It helps you to automate tasks, optimize SQL code, compare schemas and data, and more. In this article, we will highlight some of the new features and enhancements in Toad for Oracle 12.6, which was released in August 2014.

## ASH Browser
 
One of the new features in Toad for Oracle 12.6 is the ASH Browser, which lets you view Active Session History (ASH) data in a graphical form. ASH data is collected by Oracle and provides information about the activity and performance of sessions in the database. With the ASH Browser, you can see the distribution of sessions by different criteria, such as wait class, event, SQL ID, session state, module, or service. You can also drill down to see the details of the most active sessions, such as their SQL text, execution plan, statistics, and bind variables. The ASH Browser is available in the DBA Module only.
 
## ASM Manager
 
The ASM Manager is a tool that helps you to manage Automatic Storage Management (ASM) instances and disk groups. ASM is a feature of Oracle that provides a logical layer of storage management between the database and the physical disks. In Toad for Oracle 12.6, the ASM Manager has two new tabs: Space History and IO History. These tabs show you the historical trends of space usage and IO activity for ASM disk groups and files. You can also export the graphs to Excel or view them in full screen mode.
 
## Tablespace Window
 
The Tablespace window is a tool that helps you to monitor and manage tablespaces and datafiles in your database. A tablespace is a logical unit of storage that consists of one or more datafiles. In Toad for Oracle 12.6, the Tablespace window has been enhanced with the following features:
 
- The By Datafile checkbox on the Space History tab is now next to the Datafiles field, and you can now select multiple files.
- The Tablespace and Datafile drop-down lists on the Tablespace Space Manager graphs are now multiselect enabled.
- You can now export the graphs to Excel by right-clicking the grid.
- A new toolbar button on the Space History graph takes you to a new Object Growth chart in the AWR Browser.

## Query Builder
 
The Query Builder is a tool that helps you to create SQL queries visually by dragging and dropping tables and columns from the Schema Browser. You can also edit the query conditions, joins, groupings, orderings, and aliases using a graphical interface. In Toad for Oracle 12.6, the Query Builder has a new option to limit the size of table entities to a specified number of columns. This makes it easier to work with tables that have many columns without cluttering the Query Builder window. You can also scroll through the columns within an entity using a scroll bar.
 
## Unified Audit Policies
 
Unified Audit Policies are a new feature in Oracle 12c that allow you to create audit policies that apply to multiple objects or actions in your database. For example, you can create a policy that audits all DML operations on tables in a specific schema or all connections using a specific service name. In Toad for Oracle 12.6, there is a new Unified Audit Policies tab in the Schema Browser that lets you view, create, and alter unified audit policies using a context menu or a dialog box. You can also filter the policies by name or status. The Unified Audit Policies tab is available in the DBA Module only.
